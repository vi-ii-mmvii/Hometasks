Aardvark approached the abbey. It was a calm morning, and he carried a small bag. 
Suddenly, he noticed a sign that said: 'Apply_bright_colors' near an old bookstore. 
Inside, there were books on ArtHistory and PythonProgramming. 
He picked up one titled 'CamelCaseToSnakeCase' and started reading. 
The cover read: 'The_ultimate_guide_to_regular_expressions'.

After some time, he whispered to himself: 'I should_replace spaces,commas.and.dots with colons:it's more structured.' 
He left the store, ready to turn his ideasIntoReality.
